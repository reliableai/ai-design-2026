# Blog Guidelines — Version 1

## Audience

**General tech-curious readers** — people who are interested in technology but don't have a technical background. Think: a smart friend who reads Wired or listens to tech podcasts, but doesn't code.

## Tone

- Conversational and engaging
- Avoid jargon; if you must use a technical term, explain it
- Use analogies to make complex ideas relatable
- It's okay to express excitement or curiosity

## Structure

- **Title**: Catchy, informative — would someone click on this?
- **Opening hook**: First 2-3 sentences should grab attention
- **Body**: Explain the key ideas, building from simple to complex
- **Concrete example**: Include at least one real-world example or analogy
- **Takeaway**: End with why this matters or what's next

## Length

**600-800 words**

Not a hard limit, but this is the sweet spot. Enough to explain, not so much that readers lose interest.

## What to Include

- The main problem or question the article addresses
- The key insight or solution
- Why it matters (so what?)
- At least one concrete example or analogy

## What to Avoid

- Jargon without explanation
- Excessive hedging ("it might possibly perhaps...")
- Copying structure or phrasing directly from the source
- Bullet-point lists (write in prose)
- "In this blog post, we will discuss..." — just start

## Example Opening (for inspiration)

*Bad*: "This article discusses recent advances in machine learning optimization techniques and their applications."

*Good*: "Training an AI used to be like teaching a child by showing them a million flashcards. What if there was a shortcut?"
