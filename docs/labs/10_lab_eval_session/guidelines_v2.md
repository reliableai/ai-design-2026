# Blog Guidelines — Version 2

## Audience

**ML practitioners and researchers** — people who work with machine learning professionally. They know the basics, they've trained models, they want to know what's new and whether it's useful for their work.

## Tone

- Direct and efficient
- Technical terms are fine — don't over-explain basics
- Opinionated is okay; wishy-washy is not
- Skeptical but fair

## Structure

- **Title**: Clear and specific — what is this actually about?
- **TL;DR**: 2-3 sentence summary up front
- **The Problem**: What limitation or gap does this address?
- **The Approach**: What's the key technical idea? (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Results**: What worked? What are the numbers?
- **Limitations**: What doesn't work? Where does it fail?
- **Bottom Line**: Should I care? Should I try this?

## Length

**400-500 words**

Practitioners are busy. Get to the point.

## What to Include

- The specific technical contribution
- Quantitative results if available
- Comparison to alternatives/baselines
- Honest limitations
- Your assessment: is this useful?

## What to Avoid

- Hype ("revolutionary", "groundbreaking")
- Excessive background (assume reader knows the field)
- Vague claims without specifics
- Long introductions — start with the meat
- Marketing language

## Example Opening (for inspiration)

*Bad*: "Large language models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, opening up exciting new possibilities for researchers and practitioners alike."

*Good*: "This paper cuts LLM inference costs by 40% using speculative decoding. Here's whether it's worth implementing."

Remember: Your reader could just read the paper. Why should they read your summary instead? Save them time, give them an honest take.
