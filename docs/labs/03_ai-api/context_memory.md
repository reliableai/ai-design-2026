# Context and Memory Management

*Treating context as a first-class design element*


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this reading, students should be able to:

- Explain how AI systems operate on **constructed context** that combines instructions, history, retrieved information, and memory.

- Contrast AI context management with **traditional state management** in software systems.

- Describe the implications of context being **ephemeral, selectively assembled, and probabilistically interpreted**.

- Identify **design decisions** about what to include, persist, and forget—and their effects on system behavior.

- Explain the challenges introduced by **long-term memory**: influence on future decisions, privacy concerns, and feedback loops.

- Treat context and memory as **first-class design elements** rather than implementation details.


## 1. What is context in AI systems?

TODO
- Instructions
- Interaction history
- Retrieved information
- Memory


## 2. How context differs from traditional state

TODO
- Ephemeral vs persistent
- Selectively assembled
- Probabilistically interpreted


## 3. Design decisions in context construction

TODO
- What to include
- What to persist
- What to forget


## 4. Short-term context management

TODO
- Context windows
- Summarization
- Retrieval augmentation


## 5. Long-term memory

TODO
- Types of memory (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- Storage and retrieval mechanisms


## 6. Challenges with long-term memory

TODO
- Influence on future decisions
- Privacy concerns
- Feedback loops
- Auditability


## 7. Context and memory as design elements

TODO
- Making decisions explicit
- Predictability
- Safety
- User expectations
