<h1>Uncertainty vs Variability</h1>
<p class="series-title">Part 2b of <em>Optimizing in the Dark:<br>Organizational Blindness in AI Evaluations</em></p>

<p><em>When you see a range, what does it mean?</em></p>

<p>&larr; <a href="./part-2-cost-of-ignorance.html">Part 2: The Cost of Ignorance</a> | <a href="./index.html">Series Index</a></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Orientation.</strong> This section introduces a distinction used throughout the rest of the series: <em>variability</em> describes real differences in the world, while <em>uncertainty</em> describes limits in our measurement of a metric. Confusing the two leads to systematic evaluation errors.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>The M×C Matrix: What You're Actually Optimizing</h2>

<p>You have <strong>M agents</strong> (Incident Auto-Resolution, Incident Summarization, Knowledge Base Deduplication, Document Classification, ...) and you are considering deploying them across <strong>C customers</strong> (Customer A, Customer B, Customer C, ...). Each cell in this matrix has a <em>value distribution</em>: V<sub>m,c</sub> - in other words, each of these cell is a random variable.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="./images/mxc-matrix.svg" alt="M×C Matrix showing value distributions across agents and customers" style="max-width: 100%; border: none; box-shadow: none;">
</figure>

<p><strong>The aggregates matter too:</strong> You can also consider what happens at the row and column level, that is, the value of one agent (across customers) of the value for a customer that implements some - or all - of the agents. Those are random variables, too. And you can think about statistics such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Row totals</strong>: E[V<sub>m,*</sub>] = expected value of agent m across all customers, or, P(E[V<sub>m,*</sub>]>0) = probability that a customer will see a positive value from agent m.</li>
    <li><strong>Column totals</strong>: E[V<sub>*,c</sub>] = expected value for customer c across all agents, or, P(E[V<sub>*,c</sub>]>0) = probability that a customer will see a positive value from the agents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each cell is <em>unknown</em>. We have <em>beliefs</em> about it, with varying degrees of uncertainty. It is very common to be uncertain about these distributions - what is not acceptable is to be unaware that we have such uncertainty and avoid asking ourselves questions about it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Uncertainty vs. Variability: The Critical Distinction</h2>

<p>When you see distributions or "bars" around a value, you need to be sure you understand what they represent. And you want to make sure the presenter knows what they represent.</p>

<p>If somebody says <em>"We expect our incident resolution agent to have a value/cost savings of $12 per run, plus or minus $4,"</em> <strong>you MUST ask what they mean</strong>.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>What they might mean</th>
            <th>Interpretation</th>
            <th>Can we reduce it?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Uncertainty</strong></td>
            <td>"We believe the average is somewhere between $8 and $16, but we're not sure which"</td>
            <td><strong>YES</strong> — better measurement narrows the range</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Variability</strong></td>
            <td>"We're confident the average is $12, but some customers will be around $8, some other customers will see $16"</td>
            <td><strong>NO</strong> — this is real-world difference, not measurement error</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This distinction is fundamental:</p>

<p><strong>Uncertainty</strong> is about our <em>knowledge</em>. It reflects the fact that we haven't measured enough, or our measurements are noisy, or our judges are inconsistent. Uncertainty can be reduced by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Larger test sets</li>
    <li>Better sampling</li>
    <li>More consistent evaluation criteria</li>
    <li>Multiple judges with adjudication</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Variability</strong> is about <em>reality</em>. It reflects the fact that different customers have different data quality, different languages, different processes. Variability across customers (the fact that E[V<sub>m,c1</sub>] ≠ E[V<sub>m,c2</sub>]) cannot be reduced via better measurement. It can only be addressed via:</p>
<ul>
    <li>More adaptive agent implementations</li>
    <li>Selective deployment (only deploy where E[V] > 0)</li>
    <li>Better matching of agents to customer characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h3>This uncertainty is different</h3>

<p>With measurement uncertainty, better evaluation narrows your range. You become more confident about the true E[V].</p>

<p>With cross-customer variability:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Better measurement makes you <em>more confident about the variance</em> — you learn precisely how much performance differs across customers</li>
    <li>But better measurement <em>doesn't reduce</em> the variance — it's real variability in the world, not measurement error</li>
</ul>

<p>If you evaluate on Customer C's data, you don't make the agent work better for Customer C. You just learn that it doesn't work well there.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What can you do to address variability?</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Improve the system:</strong> Make the agent more robust to different data distributions. This actually reduces the variance.</li>
    <li><strong>Deploy selectively:</strong> Learn which customers (or which data characteristics) predict success, and only deploy where you expect E[V] > 0.</li>
    <li><strong>Set expectations:</strong> If you deploy broadly, communicate that results will vary. Some customers will see great results; some won't.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key point: this is not a measurement problem. It's a real-world variability problem. Recognizing the difference matters for deciding where to invest effort.</p>
