<h1>Uncertainty vs Variability</h1>
<p class="series-title">Part 2b of <em>Optimizing in the Dark:<br>Organizational Blindness in AI Evaluations</em></p>

<p><em>When you see a range, what does it mean?</em></p>

<h2>The M×C Matrix: What You're Actually Optimizing</h2>

<p>When you deploy AI agents across an enterprise, you're not optimizing a single number. You're optimizing a <em>matrix</em>.</p>

<p>Consider: you have <strong>M agents</strong> (Incident Auto-Resolution, Incident Summarization, Knowledge Base Deduplication, Document Classification, ...) deployed across <strong>C customers</strong> (Customer A, Customer B, Customer C, ...). Each cell in this matrix has a <em>value distribution</em>: V<sub>m,c</sub>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="./images/mxc-matrix.svg" alt="M×C Matrix showing value distributions across agents and customers" style="max-width: 100%; border: none; box-shadow: none;">
</figure>

<p><strong>What's in each cell?</strong> A distribution of value. Not a single number—a random variable. For Incident Auto-Resolution at Customer A, sometimes it saves 15 minutes, sometimes 5, sometimes it makes things worse and costs 10 minutes. The distribution captures this reality.</p>

<p><strong>The aggregates matter too:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Row totals</strong>: E[V<sub>m,*</sub>] = expected value of agent m across all customers</li>
    <li><strong>Column totals</strong>: E[V<sub>*,c</sub>] = expected value for customer c across all agents</li>
</ul>

<p>Each cell is <em>unknown</em>. We have <em>beliefs</em> about it, with varying degrees of uncertainty. And this is where things get interesting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Uncertainty vs. Variability: The Critical Distinction</h2>

<p>When you see distributions or "bars" around a value, you need to be sure you understand what they represent. And you want to make sure the presenter knows what they represent.</p>

<p>If somebody says "We expect our incident resolution agent to have a value/cost savings of $12 per run, plus or minus $4," <strong>you MUST ask what they mean</strong>.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>What they might mean</th>
            <th>Interpretation</th>
            <th>Can we reduce it?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Uncertainty</strong></td>
            <td>"We believe the average is somewhere between $8 and $16, but we're not sure which"</td>
            <td><strong>YES</strong> — better measurement narrows the range</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Variability</strong></td>
            <td>"We're confident the average is $12, but Customer A sees $8, Customer B sees $16"</td>
            <td><strong>NO</strong> — this is real-world difference, not measurement error</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This distinction is fundamental:</p>

<p><strong>Uncertainty</strong> is about our <em>knowledge</em>. It reflects the fact that we haven't measured enough, or our measurements are noisy, or our judges are inconsistent. Uncertainty can be reduced by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Larger test sets</li>
    <li>Better sampling</li>
    <li>More consistent evaluation criteria</li>
    <li>Multiple judges with adjudication</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Variability</strong> is about <em>reality</em>. It reflects the fact that different customers have different data quality, different languages, different processes. Variability across customers (the fact that E[V<sub>m,c1</sub>] ≠ E[V<sub>m,c2</sub>]) cannot be reduced via better measurement. It can only be addressed via:</p>
<ul>
    <li>More adaptive agent implementations</li>
    <li>Selective deployment (only deploy where E[V] > 0)</li>
    <li>Better matching of agents to customer characteristics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The questions you must ask:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>"Is that uncertainty or variability?"</li>
    <li>"Does the presenter even know what they mean?"</li>
</ol>

<p>When someone presents a range and can't answer these questions, the number is not just uncertain—it's <em>uninterpretable</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>One Agent, Many Customers</h2>

<p>So far in Part 2 we discussed M agents for one customer. But there's another dimension: deploying one agent across N customers.</p>

<p>This introduces a different kind of uncertainty — one that better measurement can <em>reveal</em> but cannot <em>reduce</em>.</p>

<p>You have one agent — say, Incident Auto-Resolution — and 10 customers considering deployment. You've evaluated thoroughly and you're confident: E[V] = +8, range [+5, +11].</p>

<p>Should you deploy to all 10 customers?</p>

<p>Your evaluation was done on some dataset — maybe a mix of data from several customers, maybe synthetic data, maybe data from your most engaged pilot customer.</p>

<p>But each customer's data is different:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customer A has clean, well-structured tickets with consistent formatting</li>
    <li>Customer B has messy tickets with lots of jargon and abbreviations</li>
    <li>Customer C has tickets in multiple languages</li>
    <li>Customer D has a ticket system that truncates long descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>The agent might perform very differently across these environments. Your confident E[V] = +8 might actually be:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Customer</th>
            <th>True E[V]</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>+15</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B</td><td>+2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C</td><td>−5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>D</td><td>+12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>E</td><td>+8</td></tr>
        <tr><td>F</td><td>−3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>G</td><td>+10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>H</td><td>+6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I</td><td>+1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>J</td><td>−8</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your aggregate evaluation gave you confidence, but the reality is: 3 out of 10 customers would be harmed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>This uncertainty is different</h3>

<p>With measurement uncertainty, better evaluation narrows your range. You become more confident about the true E[V].</p>

<p>With cross-customer variability:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Better measurement makes you <em>more confident about the variance</em> — you learn precisely how much performance differs across customers</li>
    <li>But better measurement <em>doesn't reduce</em> the variance — it's real variability in the world, not measurement error</li>
</ul>

<p>If you evaluate on Customer C's data, you don't make the agent work better for Customer C. You just learn that it doesn't work well there.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What can you do?</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Improve the system:</strong> Make the agent more robust to different data distributions. This actually reduces the variance.</li>
    <li><strong>Deploy selectively:</strong> Learn which customers (or which data characteristics) predict success, and only deploy where you expect E[V] > 0.</li>
    <li><strong>Set expectations:</strong> If you deploy broadly, communicate that results will vary. Some customers will see great results; some won't.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key point: this is not a measurement problem. It's a real-world variability problem. Recognizing the difference matters for deciding where to invest effort.</p>
