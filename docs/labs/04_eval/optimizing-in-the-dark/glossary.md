## Notation

- Scores are in **percentage points** ("points").
- `σ` = standard deviation of **one-run measurement noise** for a single system (random error).
- `±h` = approximate **95% confidence interval half-width** (so CI width is `2h`).
- When comparing two systems with independent noise `σ`, the noise on the difference is `√2 · σ`.
