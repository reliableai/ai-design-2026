    <h1>Syllabus</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">Spring 2026</p>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      This course provides a comprehensive introduction to designing, building, and evaluating
      large-scale AI systems. Students will gain hands-on experience building AI-powered applications
      and learn rigorous evaluation methodologies essential for deploying AI systems in production.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and implement AI-powered applications using agents, tools, and memory systems</li>
      <li>Understand and apply MCP-style connectors for system integration</li>
      <li>Design comprehensive evaluation frameworks for AI systems</li>
      <li>Create and refine golden datasets for testing</li>
      <li>Implement LLM-as-judge evaluation approaches</li>
      <li>Conduct rigorous experimental design and ablation studies</li>
      <li>Perform error analysis and quantify uncertainty in AI system outputs</li>
      <li>Architect scalable AI systems with appropriate safety guardrails</li>
      <li>Communicate technical design decisions and evaluation results effectively</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The course spans 12 weeks with two 2-hour lessons per week (24 lessons total).
      It is organized into three phases:
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 1: Building an AI-Powered App (Lessons 1-4)</h3>
    <p>
      Rapid introduction to building AI applications. Covers the <a href="ai_tools_integration.html">architecture of large scale AI services</a>,
      working AI agents with tools, memory, and MCP-style connectors.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 2: Evaluation of AI Systems (Lessons 5-12)</h3>
    <p>
      Deep dive into evaluation methodologies: metrics, golden datasets, LLM-as-judge,
      experimental design, error analysis, and uncertainty quantification.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 3: Project-Driven Work (Lessons 13-24)</h3>
    <p>
      Apply everything in a substantial project. This phase includes the midterm exam,
      project reviews, working sessions, and final presentations.
    </p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming proficiency (Python preferred)</li>
      <li>Basic understanding of machine learning concepts</li>
      <li>Familiarity with APIs and web services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <table class="grading-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Component</th>

    </table>

    <h2>Course Policies</h2>

    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>
      Attendance is expected for all lessons. Phase 3 sessions are particularly important
      as they include project reviews, working sessions, and presentations.
    </p>

    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      All work submitted must be your own (or your team's for the project). You may use
      AI tools to assist with coding and learning, but you must understand and be able
      to explain all code and concepts in your submissions.
    </p>

    <h3>Late Submissions</h3>
    <p>
      Late submissions for the project milestones will be penalized unless prior arrangements
      are made. The midterm exam must be taken at the scheduled time.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      The midterm exam is strictly individual. For the project, teams of up to 2 students
      are allowed. All team members are expected to contribute equally.
    </p>

    <h2>Office Hours</h2>
    <p>
      Office hours are held right after each class. Additional appointments can be
      scheduled via email.
