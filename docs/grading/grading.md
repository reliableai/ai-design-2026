# AI Design Project – Grading Rubric (0–30)

Each project is graded on **three equally weighted dimensions** (0–10 each).

---

## 1. Design & Prototypes (0–10)

How well did the student *design* and *instantiate* the system?

Consider:
- Are the **goals** and task clearly defined?
- Are there **meaningful design choices / alternatives** (e.g., tools, models, workflows, memory)?
- Is there at least one **working prototype**, ideally more than one variant?
- Is the implementation sufficient to **test** the design choices?

Scoring guidelines:
- **0–3**: Vague or single design, little rationale; prototype missing or barely usable.
- **4–7**: Clear design with some alternatives and a runnable prototype; rationale partially justified.
- **8–10**: Thoughtful design with clear alternatives, trade-offs, and solid prototypes that reflect the design.

---

## 2. Experiments & Analysis (0–10)

How well did the student **evaluate** their design?

Consider:
- Are there **experiments** comparing different variants / configurations?
- Are **metrics or evaluation criteria** clearly stated and appropriate?
- Is there **honest analysis** of results (including failures)?
- Is there reflection on **limitations / uncertainty**?

Scoring guidelines:
- **0–3**: Little or no experimentation; metrics unclear; results mostly anecdotal.
- **4–7**: Some experiments with reasonable metrics and comparisons; analysis is present but shallow or uneven.
- **8–10**: Well-structured experiments, clear metrics, informative comparisons, and thoughtful discussion of what was learned.

---

## 3. Communication & Structure (0–10)

How clearly did the student **explain** what they did and why?

Consider:
- Is the report **well-structured** (e.g., problem → design → experiments → conclusions)?
- Are the **motivations and choices** explained in plain language?
- Is the writing **clear and concise**, without major gaps?
- Does the conclusion **summarize key lessons** about design and experimentation?

Scoring guidelines:
- **0–3**: Hard to follow; missing sections; unclear reasoning.
- **4–7**: Generally understandable; some reasoning and structure, but with rough spots.
- **8–10**: Clear, well-organized, and easy to follow, with strong explanation of choices and lessons learned.
